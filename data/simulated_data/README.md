# Simulated RV Data

Radial velocity measurements for 10,000 exoplanetary systems was simulated using Monte Carlo techniques with RadVel. A Gaussian instrumental error of 5 m/s was added to the simulated data. To simulate the noise produced by stellar activity and dark spots, [SOAP 2.0](http://www.astro.up.pt/resources/soap2/) was used with randomly generated stellar configurations. A total of 20,000 stellar activity radial velocity curves were obtained. 10,000 of these stellar activity radial velocity curves were injected with the 10,000 exoplanetary radial velocity curves. 

### Data Summary:
- 10,000 radial velocity curves of pure stellar activity without any exoplanets
- 10,000 radial velocity curves of exoplanetary systems with solar activity
